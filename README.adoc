= RHQ-Pi-plugin

This plugin is to support some of the Raspberry PI (TM) hardware features.

== One Wire Bus

The plugin recognizes temperature sensors on the 1-wire-bus.

To get the Pi to recognize them you have to run

[source,shell]
----
# modprobe w1-gpio pullup=1
# modprobe w1-therm
----

and perhaps (to make this survive reboots) also add

[source,shell]
----
w1-gpio pullup=1
w1-therm
----

to `/etc/modules`

== GPIO Pins

For now only output pins are supported.
(at the example of pin 27):

[source,shell]
----
# cd /sys/class/gpio
# echo 27 > export
# cd gpio27
# echo out > direction
----
